Design a web-based enterprise application for the Armenian Genocide Museum that helps museum staff create multi-language audio guides from source documents. The product is a 3-stage guided workflow with tabs, plus a Project Dashboard to manage saved guides. The UI must be professional, accessible, and optimized for long-form text editing and review.

Overall Structure

Top navigation:

Dashboard

Source Materials

Translation

TTS & Audio Output

Dictionaries & Terms (optional as a separate view OR as a panel within stages)

Each stage should show a stepper and progress indicators for long-running operations.

Each project has:

Project name, ID, creation date, last modified, status (Draft / Translating / TTS Generating / Ready)

Source language (strict), target languages (one or many), term dictionary status, export status

Key Requirements Across All Stages

Show progress for: file upload, document parsing, term detection, translation, audio generation, export packaging

Strict source language lock: a project must use exactly one source language (no mixing). Supported initially: Armenian, English, Russian

Support import formats: .md, .pdf, .doc/.docx, .txt

Staff can upload special dictionary files; uploading triggers AI structuring into a standardized JSON.

Detect and manage special terms in text:

Toponyms

Ethnonyms

Historical Terms

Figures

Dates

Detected terms must be:

Highlighted in text

Editable manually and with AI assistance

Exportable as structured JSON

Mergeable with uploaded dictionary files

Dictionary JSON must include per term:

Category

Source spelling

Target language forms (when available)

Phonetic pronunciation hints / transliteration / IPA for source and target

Notes, confidence, validation status

Screen 1: Project Dashboard

Purpose: manage existing audio guide projects.

Table/grid of projects with filters: status, source language, target languages, date, search.

Project cards show a progress bar of overall workflow completion.

Actions: Create new project, Duplicate, Archive, Export, Open.

“Create project” modal:

Project name

Choose source language (Armenian/English/Russian)

Select one or multiple target languages (global list)

Optional: upload initial documents + dictionary

Tab 1: Source Materials (Upload + Text Processing + Term Detection)

Layout: 3-column workspace.

Left panel: Sources

Upload area for documents (drag/drop) with file list, type icon, upload progress, parsing status

Buttons: Add files, Remove, Reorder, Combine selections

Strict language indicator: “Source language locked: Armenian/English/Russian”

Center panel: Editor

Large document editor with sections, headings, merge view, version history

Tools:

Manual edit

AI assist: summarize, rewrite, simplify, merge selected, remove duplicates, style normalization

“Combine sources” into a single curated script

Highlight detected terms inline (color-coded by category)

Right panel: Term Detection & Dictionary

“Run Term Detection” button with progress bar + logs

Term list grouped by category (Toponyms, Ethnonyms, Historical Terms, Figures, Dates)

Each term row: confidence, occurrences, edit button, pronunciation fields

Upload dictionary file button → triggers “Smart AI processing”

Merge options:

Merge detected + uploaded

Resolve conflicts UI (side-by-side suggestions)

Export dictionary button: Download JSON

Bottom action bar:

Back/Save Draft

Submit to Translation (locks source script version)

Tab 2: Translation (Multi-language + Term Validation + Phonetic Refinement)

Goal: translate curated script into one or multiple target languages with term consistency.

Layout: split screen with an additional dictionary refinement panel.

Top: Target language selector (multi-select), translation status per language, progress bars.

Main area:

Left pane: Source script (read-only, with highlighted terms)

Right pane: Target translation editor (editable)

Toggle: side-by-side / stacked view

Term consistency features:

Term glossary sidebar showing expected translations/transliterations per target language

Warnings when translation deviates from glossary or term detection

“AI Assist” in this phase:

Improve translation tone

Fix consistency for toponyms/ethnonyms

Generate phonetic hints for target language (e.g., Arabic/Chinese/Japanese)

Dictionary JSON refinement:

Dedicated panel to edit:

Target-language term forms

IPA/transcription fields

Notes and approval

Mark terms as Approved/Needs Review

Bottom action bar:

Save

Proceed to TTS & Audio Output (locks translation version per language)

Tab 3: TTS & Audio Output (Vendor-specific Voices + SSML Preview + Generation)

Goal: generate high-quality audio files with advanced speech controls.

Layout: settings dashboard + preview + output queue.

Left panel: Vendor + Voice Profile

Vendor dropdown: Google TTS, ElevenLabs, Qwen, Other

Vendor selection dynamically changes:

Available voices

Voice cloning / voice creation options

Supported SSML features

Voice profile card: sample playback, tags (gender/age/style), language compatibility

Center panel: Speech Controls (sliders + advanced settings)

Sliders:

Emphasis (dramatic stress)

Gravity (Somberness)

Pacing

Pause distribution

Additional options:

Pronunciation strictness (use dictionary strongly vs softly)

Segmenting (by paragraph / by section)

Noise reduction / normalization toggle (if applicable)

Right panel: SSML / Vendor Preview

“SSML Preview” window showing how dictionary phonetics become vendor SSML (e.g., )

Warnings for unsupported tags per vendor and auto-fallback

Output section:

Audio format selector (mp3/wav/ogg), bitrate/quality

Generate button with multi-stage progress (preprocessing → SSML compile → synth → package)

Output file list per target language with status, download, regenerate, audit log

Bottom action bar:

Save settings

Generate

Export final package (audio + script + dictionary JSON + metadata)

Visual & UX Style

Museum-grade, serious tone; minimal but modern design (clean typography, calm color palette)

Accessibility: high contrast options, keyboard-friendly editor controls

Use clear status chips, progress bars, and activity logs for AI operations

Provide confirmation dialogs when locking versions between stages

Deliverables Requested from Stitch

High-fidelity mockups for:

Dashboard

Source Materials tab (with term detection + dictionary merge UI)

Translation tab (multi-language + glossary validation)

TTS tab (vendor-dependent voice options + SSML preview + generation queue)

Include a reusable component set: stepper, progress modal, term card, conflict resolver, SSML preview widget.
